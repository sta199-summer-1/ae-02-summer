For this ae, we'll use the **tidyverse** and **palmerpenguins** packages.

These data were collected from 2007 - 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program, part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network. The data were imported directly from the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) Data Portal, and are available for use by CC0 license ("No Rights Reserved") in accordance with the Palmer Station Data Policy.

## Packages

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins) #The data set name is penguins
```

What are the `#|` above?

## Data

The dataset we will visualize is called `penguins`. Let's `glimpse()` at it.

```{r}
#| label: glimpse

# insert code here

```

Don't forget about your ggplot cheetsheet as well!

## Single variable

::: callout-note
Analyzing the a single variable is called **univariate** analysis.
:::

Create visualizations of the distribution of `weight`s of penguins.

1.  Make a histogram by filling in the `...` with the appropriate arguments. Set an appropriate binwidth.

```{r}
#| label: histogram-weight
#| eval: false

penguins |>
  ggplot( 
       aes(x = ...)) + #type variable name here
       ... #type geom here

```

Describe the shape of this distribution below..

2.  Now, make a boxplot of `weight`s of penguins.

```{r}
#| label: boxplot-weight

# insert code here

```

3.  Add a theme to your boxplot!

https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html

```{r}
#| label: theme
#| eval: false

penguins |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = body_mass_g)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    ... # type theme here

```

Why can / should we use themes?

## Two variables

::: callout-note
Analyzing the relationship between two variables is called **bivariate** analysis.
:::

What if we want to make side by side boxplots to look at body mass across penguins? Do so below... 

```{r}
#| label: side-by-side

#insert code

```


Next, create visualizations of the distribution of `weight`s of penguins by `species`. Note: `aes`thetic is a visual property of one of the objects in your plot. Aesthetic options are:

-   shape
-   color
-   size
-   fill

4.  Make a histogram of penguins' weight where the bars are filled in by species type. Set an appropriate binwidth and alpha value. At the same time, comment each line of code to articulate what it's doing.

```{r}
#| label: histogram-weight-species
#| eval: false

penguins |>
  ggplot( 
       aes(x = body_mass_g, color = ... )) +
       geom_histogram(binwidth = 200, alpha = 1)

```

5.  What if we don't want the overlap? We can use `facet_wrap` to split the histograms apart! This function takes the name of the variable you want to split by, and how many cols/rows you want your plots to show up in. Run ?facet_wrap in your console and read the first two arguements of the function.

```{r}
#| label: facet
#| eval: false
penguins |>
  ggplot( 
       aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species )) +
       geom_histogram(binwidth = 200, alpha = .7) +
       ...
```

In 1-2 sentences, describe what you see in the plot you created.

6.  Create side-by-side boxplots to compare body mass across species. Turn off the legend so it is not displayed.

```{r}
#| label: boxplot-weight-species

# insert code here

```

7.  We need to think critically about color when thinking about creating visualizations for a larger audience: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html

We will do more with colors throughout the semester. Think about this is as our first introduction. We can create a colorblind friendly pallet using `scale_colour_viridis_d() or scale_colour_viridis_c()` depending on the type of variable we are working with. Below, comment the code below to describe what it's doing:

```{r}
#| label: color-demo

p <- penguins |> 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm , color = species)
  ) + 
    geom_point() 


p

p + scale_colour_viridis_d()

```

Change the above code to say `scale_colour_viridis_c()`. Does the code run? Why or why not? 

*Add Response* 

Let's get practice using `scale_colour_viridis_c()`. Below, create a scatterplot between bill_length and bill_depth. Color the dots of the scatterplot by the penguins flipper length. Use `scale_colour_viridis_c()` to create a colorblind friendly pallet. 

```{r}

# insert code here

```



8. We can use multiple geoms on a single plot! Be deliberate about the order of plotting. Our task is to recreate the following image below. Hint: This plot uses `theme_minimal` and `scale_color_viridis_d(option = "D")`.

Note: Themes are a powerful way to customize the non-data components of your plots: i.e. titles, labels, fonts, background, gridlines, and legends: `theme()`.

![](plot1.png){width="650" height="400" fig-align="center"}

```{r}
#| label: re-create


#insert code here


```


Above, we made note to "be deliberate about the order of plotting." Let's show why. Switch the order of the geoms used above and re-run your code. What happened?

## Optional 

Make your own plot! Revisit the geoms page here: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/

```{r}
#| label: on-your-own

```
